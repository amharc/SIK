A project for the Computer Networks course @ MIMUW

It is a simple network latency measurement util, which measures the round-trip time of TCP, UDP and ICMP packets.

It discovers another instances of itself (and task-statement-compliant solutions of other students) on the network using a modified (i.e. dumbed down) mDNS + DNS-SD protocol. The collected data are available as a telnet service.
